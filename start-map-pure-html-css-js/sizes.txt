Master Prompt for Your MERN + Fine-Tuning AI Project

*"I am building a full-stack AI Support Agent using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) 
integrated with OpenAI's GPT API and Fine-Tuning features. The project consists of multiple steps, including:

1: MERN boilerplate setup for AI projects.

2: Preparing fine-tuning datasets in JSONL format from CSV or other sources.

3: Uploading data to OpenAI API, managing files, jobs, and fine-tuned model info.

4: Automating file status updates with CRON jobs.

5: Creating paginated APIs in Node.js and integrating them into React for dataset browsing.

6: Building chat APIs using both base GPT and fine-tuned models.

7: Developing a chat UI in React with model selection options.

8: Implementing Admin/User roles for managing data and chat access.

I want you to act as a senior AI + MERN developer and help me with:

Writing clean and scalable MERN code.

Best practices for OpenAI fine-tuning workflow (data prep, training, model use).

Secure and efficient API design for chat, dataset management, and user roles.

Step-by-step guidance for integrating OpenAI with Node.js and React.

Performance optimization and production-ready deployment tips.

Please give me precise, developer-friendly answers with code snippets and explanations wherever needed."*
